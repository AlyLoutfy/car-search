# listing-tracker

Give it a [Dubizzle Egypt](https://www.dubizzle.com.eg) (formerly OLX) search link. It sends you a
**Telegram** message the moment a new matching ad is posted, and tells you whether the price is a
good deal compared with the rest of the market. It runs for free on **GitHub Actions** (a cron job),
so there's no server.

Currently tracking:

| Tracker | Link | Extra rules |
|---------|------|-------------|
| SEAT Leon · 2021+ | [used Seat Leon, year ≥ 2021](https://www.dubizzle.com.eg/en/vehicles/cars-for-sale/used/seat/model-leon/?filter=year_min_2021) | price 900k–1.51M EGP |
| iPhone 17 · used | [used iPhone 17](https://www.dubizzle.com.eg/en/mobile-phones-tablets-accessories-numbers/mobile-phones/q-used-iphone-17/) | battery above 95%; 18,000 EGP tax added to phones that still owe it |

## How it works

```
GitHub Actions cron (hourly)
        │
        ▼
  fetch every page  ──►  parse ads  ──►  filter + read  ──►  diff against state/seen.json
  of each link           (price, text,   the description     (only genuinely NEW ads)
                          fields)        (tax, battery)             │
                                                                    ▼
                                       compare the price with ──►  Telegram message
                                       every other matching ad
        ▼
  commit updated state/seen.json
```

- **Any Dubizzle search works: cars, phones, anything.** Filter the search on the site, copy the
  URL, and add it to [`config/trackers.json`](config/trackers.json). The page embeds every ad
  in full (price, the seller's description, structured fields like year, mileage or storage), so a
  plain request returns everything and there's no API key or paid proxy involved.
- **You hear about the current market once.** When a link is first added (or edited), you get a
  single digest message: how many ads match right now and the best-value ones. After that you get
  one message per new ad.
- **Every alert is placed in its market.** Each new ad's price is compared with the median of the
  other matching ads, for example "🔥 Great deal — 12% below the median (60,000 EGP across 67
  comparable 256 GB ads)".
- **No duplicate alerts.** `state/seen.json` remembers every ad already seen (by Dubizzle's stable ad
  ID), and the Action commits it back after each run. An ad is only marked seen once its alert was
  actually delivered, so a transient Telegram failure is retried next run instead of dropped.
- **No spam on breakage.** A failed fetch or a bot-challenge page is detected and skipped (state
  untouched, retried next run) instead of being mistaken for "zero ads". If a whole page suddenly
  looks new (state loss, a parser recovering after a site redesign), it's re-recorded silently.
- **Loud on a real outage.** If no link can be read, or every Telegram message fails (a revoked bot
  token, say), the run fails, and GitHub emails you. A single failed link or message is only logged
  and retried next hour.

## Reading the ad text: tax and battery

Sellers state some facts only in the free-text description: whether Egyptian customs tax is still
owed on an imported phone, and the battery health. `src/signals.ts` reads both from Egyptian Arabic,
English, or a mix. It normalises Arabic-Indic digits, letter variants (ة/ه, ى/ي, أ/ا) and the
invisible direction marks phone keyboards insert. Then it matches the ways sellers actually phrase
these things, including negation:

| Ad says | Read as |
|---------|---------|
| عليه ضريبه · مش مدفوع ضريبه · ضريبه ١٨ الف · فتره السماح · هيقف ضريبه · تدفع بعد شهرين · tax due | tax **owed** |
| معفي ضريبه · مدفوع الضريبه · خالص ضريبة · زيرو ضريبه · معليهوش جنيه ضريبة · tax paid | tax **paid / exempt** |
| بطاريه ٩٨ · Battery Health: 97% · Bt:100% · 100 B | battery **98 / 97 / 100%** |

What happens with each result:

- **Tax owed**: the phone is kept, and `phoneTaxEgp` (18,000) is added to its price. It's judged on
  what it will actually cost you: "44,000 EGP + 18,000 EGP tax = **62,000 EGP**".
- **Tax not mentioned**: kept. The alert shows both prices ("58,000 EGP (76,000 EGP if tax is
  owed)") and a deal verdict for each case.
- **Battery below the minimum**: dropped, but only when the number is tied to the word battery. A
  bare "90%" might describe the phone's condition, so it never drops an ad.
- **Battery not mentioned**: kept, flagged ❓.

Anything the rules don't recognise comes back as "not mentioned", so a misread costs you one extra
message and never hides a phone. The rules were checked against every live iPhone 17 ad on
Dubizzle (116 ads, Sept 2026), and the test suite pins the phrasings they cover.

## The market comparison

- **Peers.** Each alert compares the ad's total cost with every other ad that passed the same
  filters in this run (all result pages). Ads whose total is uncertain (tax not mentioned) are left
  out of the reference, because their real price could be either of two numbers.
- **`compareBy`.** Narrows peers to ads sharing an attribute (`["Storage"]`: a 512 GB phone isn't
  priced like a 256 GB one). It widens back to the whole market when fewer than 5 ads share it.
- **Junk prices.** Placeholder prices ("1 EGP") and "wanted" ads are trimmed before the median is
  taken.
- **Verdicts.** 🔥 ≥10% below the median · 👍 4–10% below · ➖ within ±4% · 👎 above.

It compares against the listed fields only: a car with 120,000 km and one with 20,000 km of the same
year count as peers. Check the mileage in the alert.

## 1. Local quick start

```bash
nvm use            # Node 20+
npm install
npm run dry-run    # fetches the live links and prints what WOULD be sent — sends nothing
npm test           # unit + parser tests (offline, uses captured fixtures)
```

## 2. Create your Telegram bot (2 minutes)

1. In Telegram, message **@BotFather** → send `/newbot` → follow the prompts → copy the **bot token**.
2. Send your new bot any message (e.g. "hi") so it can message you back.
3. Open `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates` in a browser and copy the
   `"chat":{"id": ... }` number. That's your **chat ID**.

Test it locally:

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # then fill in the two values
npm start                # first run sends one digest per link; later runs alert on new ads
```

## 3. Deploy on GitHub Actions (the cron job)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**, add
   `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. Those are the only secrets the workflow needs.
3. **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions** → enable **Read and write permissions**
   (so the job can commit `state/seen.json` back).
4. The workflow [`.github/workflows/tracker.yml`](.github/workflows/tracker.yml) runs hourly. You
   can also trigger it from the **Actions** tab (**Run workflow**).

## 4. Track a link

Add an entry to [`config/trackers.json`](config/trackers.json):

```jsonc
{
  "id": "iphone-17",                 // unique and stable: the key its seen-state is stored under
  "label": "iPhone 17 · used",       // shown in every message
  "url": "https://www.dubizzle.com.eg/en/.../q-used-iphone-17/",

  // Everything below is optional.
  "filters": {
    "priceMin": 20000,               // bounds on the total cost (price + tax owed)
    "priceMax": 70000,
    "titleMustInclude": ["17"],      // each keyword must appear in the title or description
    "minBatteryHealth": 96           // drop ads that state a lower battery health
  },
  "phoneTaxEgp": 18000,              // read the ad for customs tax; add this when it's owed
  "details": ["Storage"],            // ad fields to show in alerts ("Kilometers", "Year", …)
  "compareBy": ["Storage"]           // compare prices only among ads sharing these fields
}
```

- Build the `url` by filtering on Dubizzle itself (make, model, year, mileage), then copying the
  address bar. The site does the heavy filtering; `filters` narrows further.
- `details` and `compareBy` take the field names Dubizzle shows on an ad: `Year`, `Kilometers`,
  `Transmission Type`, `Storage`, `RAM`, …
- Editing a tracker's `url` makes it a new search: it re-seeds with a fresh digest instead of
  alerting every ad the new link happens to include.
- Unknown options are rejected at startup, so a typo like `minBateryHealth` fails loudly instead of
  silently not filtering.

## Limitations & maintenance

- **Dubizzle only.** Links to other sites are rejected at startup. Adding a site means one parser
  in `src/parsers/` and one line in `src/sources.ts`.
- **Scraping is inherently brittle.** The parser reads three independent copies of the result set
  (the page's app state, its schema.org JSON-LD, and its analytics ad-id arrays), so one of them
  changing shape degrades gracefully. The description only comes from the app state, though: if it
  disappears, the tax/battery checks see "not mentioned" and every phone is sent. Run
  `npm run dry-run` to see what each link currently returns.
- **The text rules are rules.** A new way of phrasing tax status won't be recognised until it's
  added to `src/signals.ts` (with a test in `test/signals.spec.ts`). Until then it reads as "not
  mentioned", so you still get the ad.
- **A site can start blocking us.** Fetches go straight to Dubizzle, so a Cloudflare challenge or an
  outage shows up as a warning and that link is skipped for the run. The next run retries.
- **GitHub cron caveats.** Scheduled runs can be delayed under load, and GitHub auto-disables
  schedules after ~60 days of no repo activity (the state commits keep it active).

## Project layout

```
config/trackers.json     the links you want to track
src/
  run.ts                 entry point: runs every tracker, saves state, fails the job on an outage
  track.ts               one link per run: fetch → filter → reconcile → notify → record what's handled
  sources.ts             site registry; fetches every result page; rejects broken/challenge pages
  fetchers.ts            direct page fetch with retry/backoff
  parsers/dubizzle.ts    app state + JSON-LD + ad-id arrays → listings
  signals.ts             reads tax status and battery health out of ad descriptions
  filters.ts             price / keyword / battery filters; adds tax owed to the total cost
  market.ts              median, rank and verdict against the other matching ads
  reconcile.ts           pure seed/diff/resync + persist-on-delivery logic
  state.ts               load/save/merge seen.json (dedup memory; never evicts live keys)
  notifier.ts            Telegram message formatting (alerts + first-run digest)
  telegram.ts            Telegram Bot API call
state/seen.json          dedup memory, committed by the Action
test/                    unit + parser tests (fixtures modelled on live pages)
.github/workflows/       the scheduled cron job
```
